A Web Component statblock for D&D 5E
====================================

Statblock5e provides an easy way to display a creature statblock that looks
almost exactly like the statblocks from the 5th edition D&D Monster Manual.

<div align="center">

</div>

This is implemented as a set of custom elements following the [Web
Components][web-components] specs: [ES Modules][es-module], [Custom
Elements][custom-elements], and the [Shadow DOM][shadow-dom].

While statblock5e has been tested the most in Chrome, it may also work in any browser that [properly implements the Web Components v1 specs][web-components]. **Make sure you are using _at least_ Chrome 61 or Firefox 63.**

  </p>
</div>

**There are _no_ dependencies** (JavaScript or otherwise), **this is entirely
self-contained**.

There's very little JavaScript actually; just a bit of boilerplate that
defines the custom elements and some minor logic for computing the ability modifiers
for the ability table. Other than that, it's pure HTML, CSS & SVG.

Here's the markup that produced the above picture. **No user-level CSS or
JavaScript is necessary.**

```html
<stat-block>
  <creature-heading>
    <h1>Animated Armor</h1>
    <h2>Medium construct, unaligned</h2>
  </creature-heading>

  <top-stats>
    <property-line>
      <h4>Armor Class</h4>
      <p>18 (natural armor)</p>
    </property-line>
    <property-line>
      <h4>Hit Points</h4>
      <p>33 (6d8 + 6)</p>
    </property-line>
    <property-line>
      <h4>Speed</h4>
      <p>25ft</p>
    </property-line>

    <abilities-block data-str="14"
                     data-dex="11"
                     data-con="13"
                     data-int="1"
                     data-wis="3"
                     data-cha="1"></abilities-block>

    <property-line>
      <h4>Damage Immunities</h4>
      <p>poison, psychic</p>
    </property-line>
    <property-line>
      <h4>Condition Immunities</h4>
      <p>blinded, charmed, deafened, exhaustion, frightened, paralyzed,
        petrified, poisoned</p>
    </property-line>
    <property-line>
      <h4>Senses</h4>
      <p>blindsight 60 ft. (blind beyond this radius), passive Perception 6</p>
    </property-line>
    <property-line>
      <h4>Languages</h4>
      <p>—</p>
    </property-line>
    <property-line>
      <h4>Challenge</h4>
      <p>1 (200 XP)</p>
    </property-line>
  </top-stats>

  <property-block>
    <h4>Antimagic Susceptibility.</h4>
    <p>The armor is incapacitated while in the area of an <i>antimagic
      field</i>.  If targeted by <i>dispel magic</i>, the armor must succeed
      on a Constitution saving throw against the caster’s spell save DC or
      fall unconscious for 1 minute.</p>
  </property-block>
  <property-block>
    <h4>False Appearance.</h4>
    <p>While the armor remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a
      normal suit of armor.</p>
  </property-block>

  <h3>Actions</h3>

  <property-block>
    <h4>Multiattack.</h4>
    <p>The armor makes two melee attacks.</p>
  </property-block>

  <property-block>
    <h4>Slam.</h4>
    <p><i>Melee Weapon Attack:</i> +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
      <i>Hit:</i> 5 (1d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage.</p>
  </property-block>
</stat-block>
```

Visual differences from the MM statblocks
-----------------------------------------

Unfortunately this statblock isn't _quite_ pixel-perfect with regards to the
statblocks in the MM. The differences are:

- **Different typefaces used.** I'm told that the body typeface used in the MM
  is _FF Scala Sans_ and the one used for the monster name headings is
  _Mrs Eaves Petite Caps_. They're not available for free from Google Fonts, so
  substitutes are used instead.
- **No textured background.** Obviously, I don't have access to the original
  textures WotC used. Even if I did, I'm not sure I'd use them since that would
  mean serving images which I wanted to avoid (scaling/resolution/deployment
  issues etc).
- **No textured block border.** Same as above.

There are probably other differences as well but I haven't noticed them. I tried
to stick as close to the original as reasonably possible; for instance, I spent
_waaay_ too much time getting the drop-shadow to be the "correct" shade of
brown and the tapered horizontal rule to render _just_ right. _Why?_ Because I
had nothing better to do and it was fun! :)


FAQ
---

### Is there a single-file version?

The [`demo.html`][demo] file in the repository HTML-imports the other HTML
source files. There's also [`demo-inlined.html`][demo-inline] which renders
exactly the same but has all the HTML-imports inlined directly into the
document.

The Python script that produces the inlined version [is also
available][inline-script].

### How do I make two-column layouts?

See the [`demo-two-column.html`][demo2c] file ([here's a rendered
image][2c-img]). The key thing to notice is the use of the `data-two-column`
attribute on the `<stat-block>` element. You can also use the
`data-content-height` attribute to tweak the layout. See [the
comments][2c-comment] in the demo file for details.

### Why aren't you using polyfills?

While polyfills for Web Components [do exist][platform], they're not perfect and
require a preprocessing stage that inlines all HTML imports and rewrites the new
CSS selectors like `:host`, `::content`, `/deep/` etc. There's no easy way to
tie all this together and frankly, I don't care enough since I'll personally
only use this for locally hosted pages rendered in Chrome.

If someone wants to do the required work to implement the whole preprocessing
pipeline, pull requests are welcome.

Version History
---------------

### 0.0.5
- Updated to the WebComponents v1 spec, since [several aspects of WebComponents v0 are being removed in Chrome 73][chrome-70-deprecations].
  - Use ES Modules instead of HTML Imports.
  - Use Custom Elements v1 instead of `registerElement()`.
  - Use `createShadowRoot()` instead of `attachShadow()`.
  - Use `<slot>` instead of `<content>`.
- Define `data-content-height` as a CSS custom property instead of as an HTML attribute, so we don't have to use a javascript hack to set the height of the stat-block.
- Rewrite `inline-imports.py` to parse the ES module and HTML template files.

### 0.0.4
- Fixed issue with text floating outside the statblock on Chrome 50+.

### 0.0.3
- Simpler way of supporting two-column layout.

### 0.0.2
- `<property-line>` can now be used for legendary actions since it doesn't
  hardcode red text.
- Support for two-column layout! See the new item in the FAQ.
- Now supporting multiple `<p>` elements inside `<property-block>`. All `<p>`'s
  after the first will have an indent like in the MM.
- Increasing h3 size to be closer to MM.
- Increasing line height of body font to be closer to MM.
- Using a new typeface for monster name heading. Should be closer to MM.
- Slightly increased body font size to be closer to MM font metrics.

### 0.0.1
- Initial release.
